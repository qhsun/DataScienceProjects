# DataScienceProjects
This page is a list of the Data Science projects I have been working on. 

## 1.Double Machine Learning (DML) Application & Visualization
Successfully improved Microsoft Office product suite usage using Double Machine Learning (DML) and reduced internal client COGS by 40% by developing a visualization framework.
- Implemented DML to resolve inherent confounding issues by finding the causal estimate between product feature usage and Net Promoter Score.
- Collaborated across office teams to model the impact of app performance duration on customer satisfaction level for multiple office products.
- Improved SLA and customer satisfaction by analyzing DML causal estimate results.
- Designed and developed a visualization framework using Python and Azure Web Service to analyze the causal relationship between feature usage, app responsiveness and NPS flux. Removed redundancy of work by partner teams to visualize DML results and enabled teams to prioritize product improvement features with an improved cost-effective time management strategy.

## 2. [Parking App](https://github.com/anushnap/seattlepark)
Created an interactive API using the Seattle Annual Parking Study, which records street parking usage at various times of day on streets throughout the city to create a suggestion for most-likely-available streets to park in based on a userâ€™s inputted destination.
- Improved parking spot visibility and navigability by finding parking spots anywhere in the world.
- Provides number of available spots by time of day, destination address and walking distance on a street.
- Used: Python, Dash, Plotly, GitHub, HTML, Heroku, Google Map API.
